## Step 1 – Choose a Real Challenge

**Prompt template:**

> I want to choose a realistic technical challenge that will push me out of my comfort zone as a developer.  
> Help me come up with ideas for projects or problems I could solve, keeping in mind that I want to learn more about **[area of interest, e.g., messaging, scalable architectures, advanced GraphQL]**.  
>  
> Show me suggestions with different levels of complexity, and explain what I would learn from each one.  
>  
> Then, help me refine one of these ideas to turn it into a challenging but feasible project that I can use as a learning base.

## Step 2 – Brainstorm with Different AIs

**Prompt template:**

> Consider the following software idea: **[DESCRIBE THE IDEA HERE]**.  
>  
> I want you to act as an experienced software architect, with broad knowledge of modern technologies, best engineering practices, and innovation in development.  
>  
> Based on this idea, help me explore it by providing:  
> - Possible technical approaches to implement the idea (e.g., architectures, paradigms, languages, frameworks);  
> - Implementation alternatives with different stacks or strategies that lead to the same result;  
> - Variations and extensions to adapt or evolve the system for new contexts or audiences;  
> - Innovative or unconventional paths, such as using AI, automation, low-code, etc.;  
> - Risks, limitations, and technical or operational challenges of each alternative, with suggestions for mitigation.  
>  
> Organize the response clearly, prioritizing practical ideas and objective explanations, as if helping in the architecture and planning phase of a real project.

## Step 3 – Validate with External Sources

**Prompt template for evaluating found material:**

> I found a relevant piece of content about a project similar to what I want to build. Here are the key excerpts:  
>  
> **[PASTE THE RELEVANT EXCERPTS FROM ARTICLE, VIDEO, POST, ETC.]**  
>  
> Based on this, tell me:  
> - Do the technical approaches I was considering still make sense?  
> - Is there anything new in this material that I should incorporate into my plan?  
> - What points from this content validate or contradict the decisions we've discussed so far?

**Prompt template for self-validation:**

> I want to validate the approaches I'm considering for the following project: **[brief project description]**.  
>  
> Please point me to real-world cases, architecture studies, or practical experiences from developers who have built something similar.  
>  
> I want to understand if these technical decisions worked in practice, what results they brought, and if there were any problems or key learnings.

## Step 4 – Consolidate an Action Plan

**Prompt template for generating ADR (Architecture Decision Record):**

> I want to create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) based on the technical decisions I've made for the following project: **[brief project description]**.  
>  
> The main decisions so far include:  
> - **[Decision 1, e.g., use Spring Boot with GraphQL]**  
> - **[Decision 2, e.g., persistence with PostgreSQL and JPA]**  
> - **[Decision 3...]**  
>  
> Help me create an ADR with the following sections:  
> - Context  
> - Decision made  
> - Alternatives considered  
> - Justification for the choice  
> - Consequences (both positive and negative)

**Prompt template for generating PRD (Product Requirements Document):**

> I want to create a PRD (Product Requirements Document) to better organize the requirements for the following project:  
>  
> **[BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE PROJECT]**  
>  
> Help me structure a PRD with:  
> - Product overview  
> - Problem it solves  
> - Target audience  
> - Key features  
> - Non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, scalability)  
> - Success criteria
